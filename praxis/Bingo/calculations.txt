definitions:
	c(x, y) => x choose y
	(x)_y => falling factorial of x until y

probability of winning in 4 calls:
	observations:
		- must involve free space
		- all possible combinations of boards = c(74, 4)
		- winning combinations = 4
	calculation:
		4/c(74, 4)

probability of winning in 5 calls:
	observations:
		- counting number of solutions can be decomposed into involving or not involving the free space
			- if free space is involved:
				- multiply number of wins in 4 calls by all of the possible choices for the fifth call
				- winning combinations: 4 * 70
			- if free space is not involved:
				- 8 possible board arrangements
			- number of possible solutions = 4*70 + 8
		- all possible combinations of boards = c(74, 5)
	calculation:
		(4*70 + 8)/c(74, 5)

probability of winning in 6 calls:
	observations:
		- number of possible wins = possible wins for 5 calls * free element
		-						  = (4*70 + 8)*69
	calculation:
		(4*70 + 8)*69/c(74, 6)

7: (4*70 + 8)*69*68/c(74, 7)

5 < n < 8: (4*70 + 8)*((69)_(74 - n))/c(74, n)

8:
	observations:
		- need to worry about overcounting number of solutions, as some boards can have multiple solutions
		- can apply previous generalized count of solutions, and subtract number of boards that have multiple solutions
		- boards with multiple solutions: 6

realization: the problem is actually asking to determine the answer through large sample sizes
